# 🚀 Master DSA Patterns – AlgoMaster 150  

This repository contains my **solutions to 150 curated DSA problems** from the **AlgoMaster** website.  
I am systematically solving problems based on **pattern recognition** to enhance problem-solving skills.  

## 🎯 Why This Repository?  
✅ **Pattern-Based Learning** – Solve problems using common DSA techniques.  
✅ **Curated Problems** – Focus on the most relevant and frequently asked LeetCode problems.  
✅ **Efficient Problem-Solving** – Learn optimal approaches for each pattern.  
✅ **Daily Progress** – Track problem-solving consistency.  

## 📂 Folder Structure  
Each folder represents a **pattern**, with solutions organized inside.

## 📌 Problem-Solving Approach  
1️⃣ **Identify the pattern** used in the problem.  
2️⃣ **Choose the right data structure** (Array, HashMap, Stack, Queue, etc.).  
3️⃣ **Optimize the solution** using pattern-based techniques.  
4️⃣ **Write clean, efficient code** and analyze time complexity.  
5️⃣ **Push the solution** to this repository! 🚀
